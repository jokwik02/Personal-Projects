# Fuzzy Matcher

**Description:**  
This project implements a high-performance fuzzy matching engine. It allows you to match a sequence of characters against a dataset of names (or other strings) and measure the efficiency of matching operations. The project includes benchmarking code to compute the mean and standard deviation of execution times for character insertions.

**Features:**  
- Fuzzy matching against a list of names.  
- Performance measurement for character push/pop operations.    
- Includes warmup routines to stabilize timing measurements.  

**Build & Run Instructions:**  

1. **Navigate to the project folder**:  
   cd path/to/FuzzyMatcher

2. **Build the project**:
   make
   
3. **Run the executable**:
   ./main

**Dependencies:**
- g++ compiler
- Standard C++ library
