# Is_Connected?

**Description:**  
This project implements a directed graph data structure and a program that checks whether there is a path between two nodes. The nodes and edges are read from a file specified as a command-line argument. The project was implemented together with a classmate, and all code in the include folder was provided by the lecturer.

**Features:**  
- Directed graph implementation
- Algorithms to find paths between nodes
- Dynamic memory allocation 

**Run Instructions:**  

1. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/GraphAlgorithms

2. **Build the program**
   ```bash
   make

2. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./is_connected airmap1.map
